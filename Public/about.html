                </h3>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
                    At Quizlet, we believe that anyone can learn anything. All it takes is a tenacious spirit, the right
                    guidance, and the tools to see it through.
                    We know that students are under more pressure than ever. It can leave them overwhelmed, be
                    anxiety-producing, and make it all too easy to burn out.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    It’s our job to give every student the tools and confidence to succeed, no matter what their
                    motivation, or what they’re striving to achieve.

                    What started as a simple tool has grown into seven different study modes, tools to help teachers get
                    the most out of their students, and activities to help classes learn and have fun together.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                    And that’s just the start. We’re working on unleashing the magic of one-on-one learning for every
                    student, shaping the future of personalized learning through an assistant to help guide and motivate
                    every learner.
